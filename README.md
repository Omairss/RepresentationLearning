# RepresentationLearning

### Introduction
This repository build on the work of https://github.com/tkipf/gae to learn representations of scientific citation data into a latent space. If latent space is then a representation of the the underlying *information* in the dataset, investigating the latent space and their correlations with features, we can begin to understand how the features interact with each other in a complex networks - such as the scientific citation network.

### Dataset
1. Citeseer
1. Web of Science
